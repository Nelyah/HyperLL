\section{cardinality estimation problem}
Finding the number of distinct elements in a data set with duplicates
is a well-known problem which is applies in many fields.

The naive solution to this problem is to examine for each element of
the data stream its belonging to a data structure $\mathcal{D}$. If
$\mathcal{D}$ doesn't contain the element we add it to the data
structure. At the end of the process, the cardinality of the data
stream is equal to the size of $\mathcal{D}$.

This solution gives the exact answer but it easy to see that is scales
very badly as the size of the data stream grows.
